Android Exploitation 

Introduction

First you need to setup an android device if you need to try some mobile hacking. You will have access to a legal virtual android ISO or a virtual machine. We need to download it from https://www.android-x86.org/download and it’s an ISO file just like a virtual disk file that will allow us to create a new android device running in our virtual box environment. 

Then go to https://www.android-x86.org/download and scroll down a little bit and you should be able to find some ISO files. Since I’m on 64 bit machine I’m going to choose Android-x86 64 bit ISO file.

Now we will download the Android-x86 64 bit ISO file and it will take few minutes depending on your connection speed and then we will come back to our virtual box as soon as it finishes and start working on the android image. Once the android ISO finished downloading I’m going to start a new virtual machine on Oracle Virtual Box Manager and I’m going to call this Android and the type is going to be Linux and I’m going to choose Version Linux 2.6/3.x/4.x(64 bits).
